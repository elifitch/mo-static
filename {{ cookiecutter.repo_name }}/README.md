## Foundation

[Foundation Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html) 6.2.0 is included with a small set of components enabled by
default. There is a list of everything you can add at [Foundation's Kitchen Sink](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html).
To add more, uncomment the appropriate includes from the `app.scss` file along
with the appropriate settings section for the component in the `_.settings.scss`
file. This is described in detail at [Foundation's Sass docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html#adjusting-css-output).

Foundation's documentation can be found at [foundation.zurb.com](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/).
To get started with what's included by default, read these docs:

* [Global styles](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/global.html)
* [Flex Grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html) and [Media Queries](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/media-queries.html)
* [Typography](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/typography-base.html) and [Helper Classes](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/typography-helpers.html)
* [Forms](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/forms.html) and [Buttons](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/button.html)

## ESlint

[ESlint](http://eslint.org/) is used for static analysis of JavaScript files. By default,
the `.eslintrc` is configured to extend [Airbnb's base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb#eslint-config-airbnbbase) configuration,
with a few small modifications:

> 2 spaces for indentation.
> No semicolons.
> Only single quotes.
> Unix linebreaks.

If you use global variables that are already defined in the DOM, add them to the `globals` object
in the `.eslintrc` to [register them](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-globals) with the linter.
