## Foundation

Foundation Sites 6.2.0 is included with a small set of components included by
default. There is a list of everything you can add at [Foundation's Kitchen Sink](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html).
To add more, uncomment the appropriate includes from the `app.scss` file along
with the appropriate settings section for the component in the `_.settings.scss`
file. This is described in detail at [Foundation's Sass docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html#adjusting-css-output).

Foundation's documentation can be found at [foundation.zurb.com](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/).
